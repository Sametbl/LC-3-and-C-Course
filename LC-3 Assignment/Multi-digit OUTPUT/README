NOTE: if you create another subroutine that use OUTPUT Sub then don't re-use SAVE and SAVE_2, because OUTPUT will modify it after called. 
NOTE: these Sub used R0, R5, R6, R7, make sure to save the values that currently stored in these Registers if you want to keep them.
Cuz the Sub will modify it.
You can treat these Subroutine, as libraries like in any High level progrmming, just copy and paste the whole thing at end of your code.
To use these Subroutine "module", store the number you need to display in R6 then just call "JSR OUTPUT", the number will be displayed.



=================== Version 1 ================
- Print out unsigned integer ( 0 to 65535 )
- Print out number stored in R6
- Registers used: R0, R6, R5, R7(RET)
- Always extend to 5 digits.    ( Ex:  34 = 00034) 
- If R6 <0 , displays '0'       (based on what I've tested)

=================== Version 2 ================
- Print out unsigned integer ( 0 to 65535 )
- Print out number stored in R6
- Registers used: R0, R6, R5, R7(RET)
- Dost not extend to 5 digits

=================== Version 3 ================
- Allow printing out Negative Number
- Print out unsigned integer ( -32768 to 32767 )  
- Does not extend to 5 digits
- Print out number stored in R6
- Registers used: R0, R6, R5, R7(RET)

___________________________________________________________________________________________
FUTURE UPDATE: 
- Reduce the number of Register used. Currently used up to 4.
