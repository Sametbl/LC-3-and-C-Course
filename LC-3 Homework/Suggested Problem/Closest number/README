2023's mid-term question
Problem: For 15 integers stored in addresses from x3000 to x300F, enter an integer X to address x3010. 
Find the smallest integer that is less than X and integer that is larger than X.

Instruction unclear: if the integer is equal to X, would it be A or B ?
=> In my solution integer that equal to X will be skipped

Idea :
- Comparing 15 integers to X, then seperate them into 2 groups : [smaller than X] and [larger than X]
- Find the Min of [larger than X] group     => B
- Find the Max of [smaller than X] group    => A

- Breakdown:
+ Create an input subroutine
+ Create a Subroutine to find Min, Max that include Negative numbers   (Hardest part)
+ Create a loop seperating 2 groups
+ Find Min and Max of the 2 groups
