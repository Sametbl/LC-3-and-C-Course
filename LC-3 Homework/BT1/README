; Task: Input 3 numbers to R0, R1 and R3. Find the Max and Min numbers then store (LOAD) them into R3, R4
; Instruction unclear: I assume that we don't have to always keep the 3 inputed numbers in R0,R1,R2, but instead we just use LABELs X,Y,Z, Max, Min to store data and Load it to indicated Registers at the end.

;The Algorithm:
; - Assume the first int is MAX, then compare this max value to other integers. If larger, the MAX value equal the larger integer. Similarly, we're comparing for smaller value to find MIN
; - I use GETC + OUT instead of IN to remove the <Input a character> message.
; - For multiple-digit input, if more integer(digit) inputed to console, then multiply the previous integer by 10 and add the latest input integer and store it. If the next character is newline (ASCII = 10) then EXIT inputing. If the the input is not integer (ASCII < 48,  ASCII > 57) then invalid messgage will pop up, prompting the user to restart the program.
; - The lengthy code exceed the offset9 to use declared variables, so I declared the variables in the middle of the code, to prevent this.
; - For printing output, since the largest number in LC3 is 65535 or 32767 (if sign bit included), I devided desired numbers by 10000, 1000, 100, 10 and printing out the quotient subsequentally, the remainder of the division is used for the next division
