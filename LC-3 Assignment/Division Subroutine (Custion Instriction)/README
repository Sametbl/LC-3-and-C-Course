MODIFICATION NOTE

=========== VERSION 1 =============
- Divide R1 by R2 (not necessary x4000 / x4001), and does not change values of R1, R2
- Store Quotient and Remainder in x5000 (or R3) and x5001
- Register used : R1, R2, R3
- Cannot work with signed integer
- Range: 0 -> 65535
- Result of 0/0 is 0, and Non-zero/0 will stuck in infinite loop 

=========== VERSION 2 ==============
- Divide R1 by R2, and does not change values of R1, R2
- Store Quotient and Remainder in x5000 (or R3) and x5001
- Register used : R1, R2, R3
- Cannot work with signed integer
- Range: 0 -> 65535
- Operation that divide by 0 will have no result and print out "Math Error" message

=========== VERSION 3 =============
- Divide x4000 by x4001 ( LABEL: num1 and num2)
- Store in Quotient and Remainder in x5000 (or R3) and x5001
- Register used R1, R2, R3
- Cannot work with signed integer
- Operation that divide by 0 will have no result and print out "Math Error" message
- Range: 0 -> 65535

=========== VERSION 4 ==============
- Divide x4000 by x4001 ( LABEL: num1 and num2)
- Store in Quotient and Remainder in x5000 (or R3) and x5001
- Register used R1, R2, R3
- Operation that divide by 0 will have no result and print out "Math Error" message
- Allow division of Negative number
- Range: -32768 -> 32767
