MODIFICATION NOTE

=========== VERSION 1 =============
- Divide R1 by R2 (not necessary x4000 / x4001), and does not change values of R1, R2
- Store Quotient and Remainder in x5000 (or R3) and x5001
- Register used : R1, R2, R3
- Cannot work with signed integer
- Range: 0 -> 65535
- Result of 0/0 is 0

=========== VERSION 2 ==============
- Divide R1 by R2, and does not change values of R1, R2
- Store Quotient and Remainder in x5000 (or R3) and x5001
- Register used : R1, R2, R3
- Cannot work with signed integer
- Range: 0 -> 65535
- Zero divide by 0 will have no result and print out "Math Error" message

=========== VERSION 3 =============
- Divide x4000 by x40001 ( LABEL: num1 and num2)
- Store in Quotient and Remainder in x5000 (or R3) and x5001
- Register used R1, R2, R3
- Cannot work with signed integer
- Range: 0 -> 65535

=========== VERSION 4 ==============
